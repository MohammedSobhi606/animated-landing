## About

This landing page is designed to showcase a brand or service with a clean, professional aesthetic. It features a blue gradient background, a newsletter subscription section, and multilingual support, making it ideal for global audiences. Built with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility, this project reflects my skills as a frontend developer with experience in MERN stack applications, including e-commerce platforms and blog systems.

The landing page serves as a portfolio piece to highlight my ability to deliver client-ready solutions, complementing my main portfolio at [mohammed-sobhi.netlify.app](https://mohammed-sobhi.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layout with Tailwind CSS grid and responsive typography (`text-base sm:text-lg`, `text-xl sm:text-2xl`).
- **Dark Theme**: Toggleable light/dark mode with `localStorage` persistence, using Tailwind‚Äôs `dark:` variants.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English, Arabic (RTL), and Spanish via `next-intl`, with a language switcher.
- **Newsletter Section**: Engaging subscription form with a blue gradient background (`from-blue-500 to-blue-700`) and CSS hover effects.
- **Clean Code**: Modular React components in JavaScript for maintainability.
- **SEO Optimized**: Locale-based routing (`/en`, `/ar`, `/es`) and meta tags for search engine visibility.
- **Contact Integration**: Telegram link ([@moha2000yahoo](https://t.me/moha2000yahoo)) for direct communication.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **Internationalization**: `next-intl` for multilingual support
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Other**: `localStorage` for theme/language persistence, CSS transitions for interactivity
